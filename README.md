> There should be an app called Shook. You could make agreements with it - like bets with friends etc. Then
you could say “but we Shook on it”

This is the idea of Shook. This repository is the place where all the files
related to the mobile xamarin based app are going. This app is under development
and you'll not find it in the app store already.<br>
It is not possible to run the app since you need credentials for the REST api.
We're working on this topic.
